 \brief Tells the delegate that the region displayed by the map view just changed.
 \details This method is called whenever the currently displayed map region changes.
 During scrolling and zooming, this method may be called many times to report updates to the map position.
 Therefore, your implementation of this method should be as lightweight as possible to avoid affecting scrolling and zooming performance.
